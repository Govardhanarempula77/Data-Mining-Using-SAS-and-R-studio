# Abstract:
The main aim is to apply different classification techniques like Linear
Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest neighbours, Decision tree models to
predict Diabetes increase rate in different ages from Pima Indians Diabetes
Database to Evaluating the accuracy of different classification models.
# Introduction:
Classification is a process of categorizing a given set of data into classes, it can
be performed on both structured or unstructured data. The process starts with
predicting the class of given data points. The classes are often referred to as target,
label or categories
